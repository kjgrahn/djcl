NAME
       djcl - execute a configured set of programs

SYNOPSIS
       djcl [-d] [-a listen-address] -p port -f config
       djcl --help
       djcl --version

DESCRIPTION
       djcl  is  a simple daemon which executes a set of programs speci-
       fied in a config file, and logs their output  (their  stdout  and
       stderr).  It  also has a socket interface for starting these pro-
       grams.

       It's a way to maintain a fixed group of processes, except no  at-
       tempt is made to restart those that exit; the user has to request
       a start.

       Like in a normal shell, the child processes inherit most  of  the
       properties  of  djcl itself. The command-line arguments, environ-
       ment and initial working directory are configurable according  to
       below.  Stdout  and  stderr  are captured and printed to the djcl
       syslog or stdout, depending on whether it's running as  a  daemon
       or not. A program terminating is also carefully logged.

SEE ALSO
       systemd.exec(5).
